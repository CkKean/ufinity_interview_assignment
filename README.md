## Steps to Run a Local Instance

1. Clone the project repository from this URL: https://github.com/CkKean/ufinity_interview_assignment.git
2. Open the codebase in your preferred IDE (e.g., VS Code)
3. Start Docker Desktop to run the MySQL database
4. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies
5. Run `npm start` to start the project. The application is ready for use if display following message. Please check FAQ if there are any issues.

```
 âœ” Container teacher-administration-system-mysql  Running                                                                                                                                                                                                         0.0s 

> teacher-administration-system@1.0.0 start
> ts-node ./src/server.ts

2023-07-05 15:50:40     [server.ts]     INFO    Application started at http://localhost:3000
```

6. You should be able to send a GET request to the following endpoint and receive a 200 response:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/healthCheck/
```

## Testing

The test suites are located in the `ufinity_interview_assignment/src/test` directory. There is one test suite with 31 test cases for the Student APIs. A default set of dummy data will be created before executing the test script. The data will remain for every test run for consistency. Please check FAQ if has any issues on executions.

### Steps to Run the Tests

1. Start Docker Desktop to run the MySQL database.
2. Run `npm test` to run the tests. The test result will be displayed if there are no problems on init database container. Please check FAQ if there are any issues.
```
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       31 passed, 31 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        8.037 s, estimated 31 s
```
3. Run `npm run test:clear` to remove the existing test database.
Note: It is better to run step 3 to clear the existing database to make consistent data.

## Database
The application uses a MySQL database to store data. The database schema is automatically created when the MySQL Docker container is initialized for the first time.

The database has three tables as ERD shows:

1. student: Stores student information
2. teacher: Stores teacher information
3. teacher_student_relationship: Stores the relationship between students and teachers

### ERD
![Database Image](ufinityInterviewERD.drawio.svg)

## Environments
There are two environments in which the application operates: test and development.

### Test Environment
  - The test environment is used for running automated tests. It has a separate MySQL database for testing purposes. The test database configuration can be customized in the .env file and add it into the /src directory. The default test database configuration is as follows:
  
    - Host: 127.0.0.1
    - Port: 33307
    - Schema: teacher-administration-system-test

### Development Environment 
  - The development environment is used for local development and testing. It has its own MySQL database. The development database configuration can be customized in the .env file and add it into the /src directory. The default test database configuration is as follows:

    - Host: 127.0.0.1
    - Port: 33306
    - Schema: teacher-administration-system

## Test Data

The following is the default sample data used for Student APIs:

- Students:
  - commonstudent1@gmail.com
  - commonstudent2@gmail.com
  - commonstudent3@gmail.com
  - commonstudent4@gmail.com
  - commonstudent5@gmail.com (Suspended)

- Teachers:
  - teacherken@gmail.com
  - teacherjoe@gmail.com
  - teacherkang@gmail.com
  - teacherping@gmail.com

- Teacher-Student Relationships:
  - teacherken@gmail.com - commonstudent1@gmail.com
  - teacherken@gmail.com - commonstudent2@gmail.com
  - teacherken@gmail.com - commonstudent5@gmail.com
  - teacherjoe@gmail.com - commonstudent2@gmail.com
  - teacherjoe@gmail.com - commonstudent3@gmail.com

Note: The student with email "commonstudent5@gmail.com" is suspended and will not receive notifications.
